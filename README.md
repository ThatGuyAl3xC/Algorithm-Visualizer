# Algorithm-Visualizer
This one is still a work in process!!!

Welcome to my Algorithm Visualizer project! This project allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action, providing an educational and interactive experience.

# Features

* Interactive Visualization: Watch how different sorting algorithms sort an array step-by-step.
* Algorithm Selection: Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Radix Sort, and Shell Sort.
* Control Panel: Adjust the size of the array and the speed of the visualization to suit your preferences.
* Reset Functionality: Easily reset the array to see the sorting process again with different parameters.

# Sorting Algorithms
## Bubble Sort
A simple comparison-based algorithm where each pair of adjacent elements is compared, and the elements are swapped if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.

## Insertion Sort
Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## Selection Sort
An in-place comparison-based algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted.

## Merge Sort
A divide and conquer algorithm that splits the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together. (STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS)

## Quick Sort
Another divide and conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.

## Heap Sort
A comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure.

## Radix Sort
A non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts integers by processing individual digits.

## Shell Sort
An in-place comparison sort that generalizes insertion sort to allow the exchange of items that are far apart.

# Usage
* Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
* Adjust the array size and speed using the sliders in the control panel.
* Click the "Start" button to begin the visualization.
* Click the "Reset" button to reset the array and start over.
